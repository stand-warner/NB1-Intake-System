# Welcome to the Mazda B6D Intake Development github!

This is a fork of Stand Racing's 1.8 ITB manifold. The 1.6 offers zero credible after-market options for intake manifolds, and the factory manifold is both heavy and restrictive. With consumer 3D printing now comfortably allowing for printing with materials like Nylon and PC which can withstand heat and offer much better layer adhesion than what we might find with ASA. 

This particular manifold will be used in a boosted application going to Pike's Peak. More updates to follow.

# Project Goals:

<br />
<br />

- ## Additive Manufacturing:
We intend to fully utilize the design flexibility that 3D printing offers by designing the system in such a way that performance compromises for the sake of manufacturing are minimal. This will allow design intricacies that other manufacturing processes would not allow.

- ## Solid-State:
Armed with this added design flexibility, we will explore the possibilities of utilizing wave reflection and intricate geometry to allow for high volumetric efficiency over a large RPM range, without additional valves.

# Iteration Process:

<br />
<br />

- ## One Range at a Time:
We are beginning this project by developing a system designed to perform well at mid-RPM with a conventional approach. We will make design changes one factor at a time until we arrive at the optimum combination of features. At this point, we move on to a high-RPM manifold design and optimize this manifold one factor at a time. After this process is complete, we will approach our broadband design equipped with the valuable data we’ve gathered along the way.

- ## Dyno is King:
While CFD testing has its uses, design changes are not verified as beneficial or consequential until there is dyno data on that change. It is for this reason that an emphasis will be placed on designs that allow for swift component changes for increasing the value of dyno testing days.

# Let’s get testing!
